          <h2>A Declaration of Principles</h2>
          <p>We, the framework knitters, croppers, and weavers of the Northern counties, do hereby declare our purposes plain. We are not enemies of machinery. We are enemies of machinery wielded as a weapon against honest labour. We welcome any invention that lightens our toil and improves our craft. We resist only those engines deployed to cast skilled hands into destitution whilst enriching masters who contribute nothing but capital.</p>
          <p>Let it be known throughout the land: we sought negotiation before action. We petitioned Parliament for a minimum wage. We proposed a tax upon cloth to fund pensions for displaced workers. These reasonable measures were rejected with contempt. Only then did General Ludd take up the hammer.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fair wages for honest work</li>
            <li>An end to child labour in the mills</li>
            <li>Safe conditions in every factory</li>
            <li>The right to organise and petition</li>
            <li>Technology that serves the many, not the few</li>
          </ul>
