          <p class="lead">Parliament mobilises a force larger than Wellington commands against Napoleon—not to defend the nation, but to crush textile workers demanding fair wages.</p>

        <div class="section center">
          <p>The government of these isles has made its position clear. When French armies threaten our shores, Parliament musters twelve thousand men. When English workers demand a living wage, they send fourteen thousand.</p>

          <p>Let that number sink into your bones, reader. <strong>Fourteen thousand soldiers</strong>—cavalry, infantry, and artillery—deployed not against a foreign invader, but against framework knitters, croppers, and weavers whose only crime is refusing to starve quietly whilst factory owners grow fat on their labour.</p>

          <p>This force exceeds what the Duke of Wellington commanded at the Battle of Talavera. It surpasses the garrison we maintain in Ireland. It represents the largest domestic military deployment in living memory, and its enemy is not Napoleon Bonaparte but Ned Ludd—a figure who may not even exist.</p>

          <h2>The Crime of Combination</h2>

          <p>What offence have these workers committed to warrant such overwhelming force? They have <em>combined</em>. They have spoken to one another across parish lines. They have dared to suggest that a man who labours sixteen hours daily ought to earn enough to feed his children.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>We are not enemies of machinery. We are enemies of machinery wielded as a weapon against honest labour. We welcome any invention that lightens our toil. We resist only those engines deployed to cast skilled hands into destitution whilst enriching masters who contribute nothing but capital.</p>
            <small class="source">From a letter signed <cite>General Ludd</cite>, February 1812</small>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800 made it a criminal offence for workers to meet and discuss wages. The Frame-Breaking Act of this very month makes the destruction of machinery a capital crime. A man may now hang for what his grandfather would have considered a legitimate trade dispute.</p>

          <h2>The Economics of Desperation</h2>

          <p>Consider the position of the framework knitter. He has served seven years as an apprentice, mastering a craft that requires precision, patience, and skill. He has invested in his own frame—often borrowing heavily to do so. He has built a reputation for quality work.</p>

          <p>Then comes the wide frame, capable of producing six stockings in the time his narrow frame produces one. The quality is inferior—any lady of fashion can tell the difference—but the price is lower. The merchant who once paid him fairly now offers a third of the rate, take it or leave it.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frame rent:</strong> Still owed to the frame owner, regardless of work available</li>
            <li><strong>Truck wages:</strong> Paid in goods from the master's shop at inflated prices</li>
            <li><strong>Deductions:</strong> For thread, for candles, for the privilege of working</li>
            <li><strong>Competition:</strong> From unapprenticed workers operating the new machines</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When all deductions are made, a skilled craftsman may earn less than a common labourer. His seven years of training, his investment in equipment, his mastery of a difficult trade—all rendered worthless by machines operated by children at a fraction of the wage.</p>

          <h2>What the Luddites Have Asked</h2>

          <p>The workers of Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, and Lancashire have not leapt immediately to the hammer. They have petitioned. They have negotiated. They have proposed compromise after compromise, each rejected with contempt by masters who see no reason to bargain when the law and the army stand behind them.</p>

          <p>Their demands have been remarkably moderate:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>A minimum price for finished goods, ensuring craftsmen can earn a living wage</li>
            <li>Regulation of the new machinery to prevent the flooding of markets with inferior goods</li>
            <li>Maintenance of apprenticeship standards to preserve the quality of English manufactures</li>
            <li>An end to truck payment, allowing workers to spend their wages as they choose</li>
            <li>The right to combine and petition—rights enjoyed by masters in their own associations</li>
          </ol>

          <p>These are not revolutionary demands. They ask only that the rules which governed English trade for centuries continue to apply—that skill be rewarded, that quality be maintained, that a working man might support his family through honest labour.</p>

          <h2>The Government's Response</h2>

          <p>Parliament's answer has been unambiguous. Rather than address the legitimate grievances of working people, they have chosen <mark>overwhelming military force</mark>. Rather than regulate the excesses of factory owners, they have made regulation of workers more severe.</p>

          <p>The message is clear: in the new industrial order, capital commands and labour obeys. The craftsman's skill, his years of training, his contribution to the wealth of the nation—these count for nothing against the factory owner's balance sheet.</p>

          <p>Lord Byron, speaking in the House of Lords against the Frame-Breaking Bill, put it thus:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I have been in some of the most oppressed provinces of Turkey; but never, under the most despotic of infidel governments, did I behold such squalid wretchedness as I have seen since my return, in the very heart of a Christian country.</p>
            <small class="source"><cite>Lord Byron</cite>, House of Lords, <time datetime="1812-02-27">February 27, 1812</time></small>
          </blockquote>

          <p>His words fell on deaf ears. The bill passed. The troops deployed. And fourteen thousand soldiers now patrol the manufacturing districts, ready to defend the profits of mill owners against the desperation of starving workers.</p>

          <h2>What Comes Next</h2>

          <p>We do not counsel violence. We do not celebrate the breaking of machines. But we understand why men driven to the edge of ruin might see no other course. When every legal avenue is closed, when petition is ignored and combination is criminalised, when the choice is between starvation and resistance—what would you have them do?</p>

          <p>The workers of England have shown remarkable restraint. Despite their numbers, despite their desperation, they have targeted property rather than persons. They have struck at the machines that threaten their livelihoods whilst leaving factory owners unharmed. This cannot be said of the government's response, which has already seen workers shot, imprisoned, and transported.</p>

          <p>The question before us is not whether machines will transform English industry—that transformation is already underway. The question is whether that transformation will benefit all Englishmen or only those who own the machines. Whether progress will lift the nation or merely enrich its masters. Whether we shall have a country of citizens or a country of servants.</p>

          <p><strong>Fourteen thousand troops</strong> suggest the government has made its choice. The question now is whether the people of England will accept it.</p>
