          <h2>The challenge</h2>
          <p>When you design in the browser from day one, you&rsquo;re working with something that <em>looks</em> real. This is both a strength and a potential problem.</p>

          <p>Stakeholders seeing an early prototype might focus on the wrong things. They&rsquo;ll notice the placeholder logo, the dummy text, the basic colors&mdash;instead of the layout, flow, and structure you&rsquo;re actually presenting.</p>

          <p><strong>Different stakeholders need different things.</strong> Some are very comfortable going through a browser. Others want to see a screenshot, a PNG&mdash;something they can annotate or share easily.</p>

          <p>The solution isn&rsquo;t to abandon in-browser design. It&rsquo;s to adapt your presentation strategy to match each stakeholder&rsquo;s comfort level.</p>
          <p class="more"><a href="#main">To top</a></p>
        </section>

        <section id="tech-savvy" class="section">
          <h2>Tech-savvy stakeholders</h2>
          <p>Some stakeholders are comfortable with technology. They understand that a prototype is unfinished. They can mentally separate structure from surface.</p>

          <h3>For these stakeholders:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Present in the browser.</strong> Share a URL. Let them click through, resize, test on their devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Walk through flows.</strong> Demonstrate the actual user experience, not static representations of it.</li>
            <li><strong>Show responsive behavior.</strong> Resize the window. Prove that layouts work across screen sizes.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate in meetings.</strong> Make changes live while they watch. Show how fast refinement can happen.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The browser becomes a shared canvas. Changes are immediate. Feedback is concrete. There&rsquo;s no translation layer between what they see and what will ship.</p>
          <p class="more"><a href="#main">To top</a></p>
        </section>

        <section id="traditional" class="section">
          <h2>Traditional stakeholders</h2>
          <p>Other stakeholders need a more curated experience. They&rsquo;re used to receiving polished deliverables. A raw prototype might confuse or concern them.</p>

          <h3>For these stakeholders:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Take screenshots.</strong> Capture specific states at specific sizes.</li>
            <li><strong>Create presentation decks.</strong> Frame screens with context and annotations.</li>
            <li><strong>Add callouts.</strong> Draw attention to what you want them to notice.</li>
            <li><strong>Control the narrative.</strong> Curate what they see and when they see it.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This isn&rsquo;t a step backward. You&rsquo;re still designing in the browser. You&rsquo;re just translating the output into a format they understand.</p>

          <h3>The hybrid approach</h3>
          <p>Many stakeholders start traditional and become more tech-savvy over time. Begin with screenshots. As trust builds, invite them into the browser. Let them experience the prototype directly. They often prefer it once they understand the benefits.</p>

        <section id="redacted" class="section">
          <h2>Redacted wireframes</h2>
          <p>One of the most powerful techniques for early presentations is redacting the content. Live Wires includes a redaction mode that replaces text with abstract shapes.</p>

          <h3>Why redact?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Focus on structure.</strong> Stakeholders can&rsquo;t get distracted by placeholder copy.</li>
            <li><strong>Show hierarchy.</strong> Typography and spacing relationships are visible without the words.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid premature feedback.</strong> No one can wordsmith Lorem Ipsum.</li>
            <li><strong>Signal incompleteness.</strong> A redacted page clearly says &ldquo;this is a wireframe.&rdquo;</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How to use it</h3>
          <p>Press <kbd>R</kbd> to toggle redaction mode, or click the <strong>Redact</strong> button in the design toolbar. This applies the <code>Flow Block</code> font to content areas, rendering text as abstract blocks while preserving size and rhythm.</p>

          <p>Combine with other overlay tools:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><kbd>B</kbd> for baseline grid&mdash;show that everything aligns</li>
            <li><kbd>C</kbd> for columns&mdash;demonstrate the underlying structure</li>
            <li><kbd>O</kbd> for outlines&mdash;reveal layout primitive boundaries</li>
          </ul>

        <section id="education" class="section">
          <h2>Stakeholder education</h2>
          <p>Part of working with stakeholders is helping them understand your process. When you design in HTML from the start, you need to explain why.</p>

          <h3>Key messages</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>&ldquo;This is the real thing.&rdquo;</dt>
            <dd>Unlike a Figma mockup, this prototype works in real browsers. When you click, things happen. When you resize, it responds. This <em>is</em> the website, just at an early stage.</dd>

            <dt>&ldquo;Changes are instant.&rdquo;</dt>
            <dd>We can adjust spacing, swap colors, try different type treatments in seconds. There&rsquo;s no handoff delay between &ldquo;design&rdquo; and &ldquo;development.&rdquo;</dd>

            <dt>&ldquo;Nothing gets thrown away.&rdquo;</dt>
            <dd>The code you&rsquo;re looking at evolves into production. We&rsquo;re not rebuilding from scratch after approval&mdash;we&rsquo;re refining what already exists.</dd>

            <dt>&ldquo;Test on your device now.&rdquo;</dt>
            <dd>Share the URL. They can see exactly how it works on their phone, their tablet, their desktop. No simulation required.</dd>
          </dl>

          <h3>Framing stages</h3>
          <p>Use clear language for each stage of refinement:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Structure</strong>&mdash;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re defining how content is organized.&rdquo;</li>
            <li><strong>Skeleton</strong>&mdash;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re establishing proportions and rhythm.&rdquo;</li>
            <li><strong>Surface</strong>&mdash;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re applying color, typography, and polish.&rdquo;</li>
          </ol>

          <p>These terms help stakeholders understand where they are in the process and what kind of feedback is appropriate.</p>

          <h2>Progressive reveal</h2>
          <p>Consider revealing complexity gradually. Don&rsquo;t overwhelm stakeholders with everything at once.</p>

          <h3>First meeting: Structure</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Present with redaction mode enabled</li>
            <li>Focus on layout and flow</li>
            <li>Discuss content hierarchy</li>
            <li>Gather feedback on organization</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Second meeting: Skeleton</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Reveal actual content</li>
            <li>Show baseline grid alignment</li>
            <li>Discuss typography scale</li>
            <li>Review responsive behavior</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Third meeting: Surface</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Apply color schemes</li>
            <li>Refine component details</li>
            <li>Polish interactions</li>
            <li>Final adjustments</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This mirrors the sculpture metaphor from the <a href="philosophy.html">philosophy</a> page&mdash;you&rsquo;re revealing the form as you carve it, not presenting everything at once.</p>
