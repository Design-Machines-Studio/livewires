                  <p>The movement began in <a href="#">Nottingham, England</a> around 1811, named after the <strong>mythical leader Ned Ludd</strong>. These weren't anti-technology peasants—they were <em>skilled artisans</em> who understood their craft intimately. Before resorting to machine-breaking, they tried negotiation. They even proposed alternatives, like a textile tax to fund workers' pensions, demonstrating remarkable economic sophistication.</p>
                  <p>What made the Luddites unique was their <mark>clear-eyed analysis of power</mark>. They didn't object to <abbr title="technology" class="acr">tech</abbr> itself, but to its deployment within exploitative economic structures. When technology helped them do their jobs better, they welcomed it. When it enriched <code>factory_owners</code> at workers' expense, they resisted. This wasn't <del>irrational fear</del> but <ins>rational opposition</ins> to a system designed to extract maximum value from their labor.</p>
